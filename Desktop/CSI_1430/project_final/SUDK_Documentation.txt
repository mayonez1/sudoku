SUDK Filetype Documentation:

Each SUDK file must begin with #START and end with #END (case is irrelevant).

Each SUDK file should begin a block with this '{' character, and end a block with this '}' character.

Each block should contain information about a single point, including row and column number, boolean data on whether the point can be modified or has been modified,
and the value that belongs at that point in the form of a character, though this is technically not necessary, it is strongly reccomended.

The marker for each type of data goes as follows (Case is irrelevant):

row data - ROW
column data - COL, COLUMN
If the point can be modified - CANMOD, CANMODIFY
If the point has been modified - MODDED, MODIFIED, MOD
The point character/value - VAL, VALUE


Comments can be written anywhere in the file and are written with an asterisk marking the beginning and end of the comment. For example: *this is a comment*
